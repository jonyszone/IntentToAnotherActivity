# IntentToAnotherActivity
It' s a simple project about using of Intent. I've created two activity and related classes. If users press button whih will appear in the first screen, it will take him/her to another activity.And there is (in the second Activity) another button to come back to the main activity.

It's very interestring feature in Android. Have Fun!
